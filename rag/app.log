INFO:rag.frontend.app:Obtained ['Generative AI: DSPy: : They argue that prompt engineering is brittle, and akin to manually finetuning weights on a classifier. This abstracts LM pipelines as *text transformation graphs*. These can be automatically optimised for better results. From the paper "DSPy contributes three abstractions toward automatic optimization: signatures, modules, and teleprompters. Signatures abstract the input/output behavior of a module; modules replace existing hand-prompting techniques and can be composed in arbitrary pipelines; and teleprompters optimize all modules in the pipeline to maximize a metric.". Prompts go from \'You are an AI assistant ....\' to \'question -> answer\'.

INFO:rag.frontend.app:Response The DSPy paper introduces a framework for automatic optimization in generative AI called DSPy. It argues that prompt engineering, which involves manually fine-tuning weights on a classifier, is brittle. Instead, DSPy abstracts language model (LM) pipelines as text transformation graphs and provides three abstractions for automatic optimization: signatures, modules, and teleprompters.

Signatures abstract the input/output behavior of a module, modules replace hand-prompting techniques and can be composed in arbitrary pipelines, and teleprompters optimize all modules in the pipeline to maximize a metric. Teleprompters are powerful optimizers included in DSPy that can learn to bootstrap and select effective prompts for the modules of any program.

The term "tele-" in teleprompters signifies "at a distance," indicating automatic prompting at a distance. The paper provides further details and insights into the DSPy framework, which can be found in the provided link. sent to 192.168.0.56
